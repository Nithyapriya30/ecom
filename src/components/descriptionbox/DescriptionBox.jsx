        <p>Online sales continue to grow. By 2026, almost a quarter of all retail sales are likely to happen onlineâ€”so if you have a small business, you should probably have a web store. The good news is that with the right tools, it's easy for any small business to quickly start selling online. With a decent eCommerce website builder, you can list your products, take payments, and handle shipping, all without leaving the comfort of your store (or home office).</p>
        <p>Solution for every kind of business, from indie creatives to multinational corporations, but for this list, I focused on platforms that best fit the needs of small and medium businesses, especially those newly exploring selling online or selling physical products. This isn't to say my picks won't work for other kinds of businesses, but if you're selling a couple of dollars a month worth of Lightroom presets or $5 million worth of potatoes, you might want to look elsewhere.</p>
